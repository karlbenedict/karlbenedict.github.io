Dr. Karl Benedict has worked since 1986 in parallel tracks of information management, geospatial information technology and archaeology. Within the College of University Libraries & Learning Sciences he serves as a Professor; as the Director of the Research Data Services (RDS) program; as the Director of Information Technology Services (ITS). His previous work experience includes fifteen years at the Earth Data Analysis Center at the University of New Mexico (including six years as the EDAC Director), for the US Forest Service, National Park Service, and in the private sector conducting archaeological research, developing geospatial databases, performing geospatial and statistical analyses, and developing web-based information delivery applications. In these positions he has developed and managed the development of information technology and data management capacity in support of multiple research and application domains including public health, resource management, hydro-climate research, atmospheric modeling, disaster planning and mitigation, and renewable energy research. In his role as the Director of RDS he works with his team to support effective research data management by researchers at UNM through instruction, training, consultation, and infrastructure support. As Director of ITS he manages a team of skilled staff that develop and support all of the IT capabilities for the College, including multiple public facing online resources, collaboration tools, critical systems and network infrastructure, and all public-facing, staff, and faculty desktop and laptop computers. His current research foci include the development of open standards-based interoperable data management workflows and infrastructure in support of diverse research projects; streamlining the integration of research data products into long-term preservation systems to maximize the ongoing value of those data beyond the projects in which they are collected or generated; and the sustainability of research data repositories and the communities that they support.

Related to his combined personal, research, and work-related interests Dr. Benedict has served in a volunteer capacity in multiple organizations that support research data management, preservation, sharing, and use. These volunteer activities include active participation in the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) since 2001, including serving three years as the ESIP President, eight years on the ESIP Board, and serving since 2019 as ESIP's Alternate Representative to the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Programme Board, the GEO Data Working Group, and GEO's GEOSS Infrastructure Development Task Team; serving as a Certified Instructor (since 2019) and Instructor Trainer (since 2022) for The Carpentries; serving as a member of the DataONE Management Team since 2019; serving as member and Chair of the External Advisory Committee for the US Virgin Islands NSF EPSCoR Track 1 Program since 2014; serving as Chair of the Technical Advisory Committee for the Digital Preservation network from 2015-2018; serving as a Member of the Data Management and Communications (DMAC) Steering Committee of the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee (IOOC, 2011-2014); and service as an appointed member of the EPA's National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (2010-2012).
