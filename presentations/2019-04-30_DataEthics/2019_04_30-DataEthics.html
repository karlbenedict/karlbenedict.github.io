</div>
		<div>Issues Raised➣ Regulatory Fit - What counts as
    research with human participants.
    Ethics oversight of private sector
    and collaborative research
➣ Requirements for and Content of
    Informed Consent - Terms of 
    service vs. informed consent
➣ Regulatory Jurisdiction for Global
    International Research Datasets -
    Current frameworks typically 
    focus on limited number of 
    jurisdictions
➣ Role of Publications in Setting
    and Enforcing Ethical Standards - 
    publishers may provide a
    common ethical requirement set

		<div>The Study➣ 689,003 randomly selected
   facebook users
➣ Posts from friends of users
   classified as positive or
   negative
➣ Facebook filtered content
   based on emotional content
   - reducing either positive or
   negative content
➣ Evaluated patterns in the
    emotional content of user’s
    posts following exposure to
    filtered posts from friends
➣ Small inverse effect found

		<div>Ohm, Paul. Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization. UCLA Law Review. August, 2010. Vol. 57(6). pp. 1701-1778</div>
		<div>“This research unearths a tension that shakes a foundational belief about data privacy: Data can be either useful or perfectly anonymous but never both.” (pg. 1704) </div>
		<div>“… integrating diverse data can lead to what some analysts call the “mosaic effect,” whereby personally identifiable information can be derived or inferred from datasets that do not even include personal identifiers, bringing into focus a picture of who an individual is and what he or she likes.” (pg. 8)
