# Assessment of the Impact of Research Data Services - a Plan for Assessment

## Introduction & Background

The *Research Data Services* program at the University of New Mexico (UNM) was established in July of 2014 as a designated service program within the College of University Libraries and Learning Sciences (CUL&LS). Though formally established in 2014, the types of services provided by RDS to the UNM research community were initiated by different programs and units within the library, including the establishment of UNM's institutional repository *LoboVault* (http://repository.unm.edu) in 2008, the hire of our first *data librarians* with subject liason responsibilities in 2010, the subsequent development of a shared data collaboration platform (LoboDrive) for use by the college and specifically defined research groups, and the expansion of support for shared code development to the entire UNM campus through the release of LoboGit (http://lobogit.unm.edu).
