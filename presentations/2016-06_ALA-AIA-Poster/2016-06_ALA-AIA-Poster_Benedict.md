# Assessment of the Impact of Research Data Services - a Plan for Assessment

## Abstract

Research data services are an emerging area of focus within academic libraries, driven by a combination of external and internal drivers that have raised the demand for a more systematic approach to research data management, sharing and preservation as part of the research lifecycle. 

## Introduction & Background

The *Research Data Services* program at the University of New Mexico (UNM) was established in July of 2014 as a designated service program within the College of University Libraries and Learning Sciences (CUL&LS). Though formally established in 2014, the types of services provided by RDS to the UNM research community were initiated by different programs and units within the library, including the establishment of UNM's institutional repository *LoboVault* (http://repository.unm.edu) in 2008, the hire of our first *data librarians* with subject liason responsibilities in 2010, the subsequent development of a shared data collaboration platform (LoboDrive) for use by the college and specifically defined research groups, and the expansion of support for shared code development to the entire UNM campus through the release of LoboGit (http://lobogit.unm.edu). When RDS was established in 2014 the data management planning and research data reference support that had been provided by subject liason librarians were transitioned to RDS, which in the Fall of 2014 was staffed with one tenured faculty member, a lecturer, a research data scientist, and a CLIR Post-Doctoral Fellow.
